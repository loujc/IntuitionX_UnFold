1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
He still hasn't responded.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
What's taking him so long?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Do you really want him to write back?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I do. No matter how he responds,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm going to destroy him with a picture of a bored cat saying,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Oh, really?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Meanwhile.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What are you doing?

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I've created some other user accounts so I can post positive comments about their paper.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This wee lil' bairn of a theory nearly blew my kilt off?

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You have to read it how Dr. Angus McDougall of the University of Edinburgh would.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
This wee lil' bairn of theory nearly blew me kilt off.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
He wrote back.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Cooper and Hofstadter resorting to juvenile attempts at humor is proof they have nothing to back up their ridiculous paper.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It should come as no surprise given they work at Cal Tech, essentially a technical school where even the physicists are basically engineers.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Engineers.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Do you know how insulting that is?

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yes.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Guys, this person's just going out of their way to get a rise out of you.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yeah, but it's still so aggravating.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
All the other comments said really nice things. Focus on those.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yeah.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Dr. Dimitri Plankovic of Moscow University said,

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
This paper great. I love it more than vodka.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
See? Better with the accent.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And send.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
What did you write?

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm done hiding from bullies. I am taking this into the real world.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What does that mean?

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I told him we'll meet him face to face anytime, anywhere.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Are you crazy? You don't know who this person is? Delete that!

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Come on, Sheldon.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Okay, okay. Calm down.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's him. He's trying to video chat.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Perhaps I shouldn't have taken this into the real world.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Oh, really?

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm so sick of people being mean on the internet.

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I think the anonymity makes everyone feel like they can say things they'd never say to your face.

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Interesting.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I can't think of a single thing I wouldn't say to someone's face.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Never noticed that about you.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You know what? At least you guys did something.

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You know, you had a theory. You wrote a paper. You made an actual contribution.

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
All guys like this do is just tear down other people's work.

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
He's right.

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yeah, I say we call this person back.

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
We've got no reason to hide.

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
All right, do it. Call him. Let's find out what this loser's ever accomplished.

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Click it with me.

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
One, two, three, click.

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Well, hello there.

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Professor Hawking?

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Oh, brother, you should see the look on your faces.

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You really didn't like our paper?

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I like your paper very much. The premise is intriguing.

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Then why are you attacking us?

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
If you were sitting in a chair for 40 years, you'd get bored too.

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Anyway, gotta go. I promise to help the neighbor kid with his math homework.

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Ciao.

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Stephen Hawking liked our paper.

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Said the premise is intriguing.

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Good to see you again, Mr. Stephen Hawking liked our paper.

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And you as well, Mr., our premise is intriguing.

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And you as well, Mr., our premise is intriguing.

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Still huh?

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,000

Still huh?

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Still huh?

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Still huh?

74
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Still huh?

75
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Still huh?

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Still huh?

77
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Still huh?

78
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Still huh?

79
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Still huh?

80
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Still huh?

81
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Still huh?

82
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Still huh?

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Still huh?

84
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000

Still huh?

86
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Still huh?

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'll admit that's pretty cool.

88
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,760
Yeah, you keep setting me up for failure.

89
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,760
Hey, is this person just going out of their way

90
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,800
to get a rise out of you?

91
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,720
Hey, is this person just going out of their way

92
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,840

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,000
Yeah, that oughta get a rise out of her.

Yeah, that oughta get a rise out of her.

95
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,960
Yeah, but it's still so aggravating.

96
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,760
Yeah, but it's still so aggravating.

97
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,640
Yeah, but it's still a risk for everything else

98
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:52,420
Who are you?

99
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,960
It's aggravating, isn't it, when someone won't answer your questions.

100
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,060
Who are you?

101
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,020
It's aggravating, isn't it, when someone won't answer your questions.

102
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
your questions.

103
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Said the premise is intriguing.

104

Said the premise is intriguing.

105
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Sounds intriguing?

106
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Not you, you need to be stitched up.

107
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Sounds intriguing?

108
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Not you, you need to be stitched up.

109
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
